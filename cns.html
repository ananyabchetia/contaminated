            <p>Oregon native Arjorie Arberry-Baribeault always had a razor sharp eye for styling hair. But when her daughter Zion was
            diagnosed with cancer at thirteen years old, followed by her best friend's son a few years later with the same
            diagnoses, Baribeault left the beauty industry for good in 2020 to investigate why.</p>
            <p>“Doing hair wasn't fun after my daughter started to lose her hair, I didn't care what anybody's hair was doing. I
                didn't
                care if it was thin on this part, or if they didn't like the color, if it was graying too fast, I didn't care about
                that,” Baribeault said. “It's not fair to do that to my clients.”</p>
            <p>Bairibeault dug for answers online and discovered JH Baxter — a wood treatment facility in West Eugene, Oregon using
                wood
                preservatives like creosote, pentachlorophenol and arsenate threatening to one's respiratory system and organs. She
                and
                her family lived near JH Baxter, along with eight other industrial sites for years.</p>
            <p>Oregon's <a
                    href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ph/healthyenvironments/trackingassessment/environmentalhealthassessment/pages/bxsite.aspx?utm_source=oha&utm_medium=egov_redirect&utm_campaign=https%3a%2f%2fwww.oregon.gov%2fjhbaxter">Environmental
                    Health Assessment Program</a> found that cases of hodgkin's lymphoma, the cancer Zion had, was
                slightly higher in neighborhoods surrounding JH Baxter compared to the county or state in 2008.</p>
            <p>Today, Zion is cancer free, and JH Baxter pleaded guilty in January to emitting hazardous waste beyond the limits set
                by
                the Clean Air Act and without a permit, a violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The company's
                president, 61-year-old <a
                    href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/companies-and-president-operating-oregon-wood-treatment-facility-pay-15m-criminal-fines">Georgia
                    Baxter-Krause</a> also pleaded guilty to making false statements to Oregon inspectors on how
                the facility handled releasing hazardous waste and was ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines.</p>
            <p>Judge Michael McShane sentenced Baxter-Krause to 90 days on April 22. Baxtet said she was ashamed many times and felt
                remorse everyday at the sentencing. She apologized to Bethel residents, the neighborhood across from JH Baxter, and
                admitted she needed to be more honest with regulators, said journalist Brian Bull, who attended the sentencing.</p>
            <p>West Eugene resident Lisa Dion said she couldn't feel her feet after hearing the weak sentence and a rush of
                “anxiety,
                nervousness, anger, sadness, frustration and confusion” kicked in. McShane said a causal link between Baxter plant
                emissions and health issues from locals could not be established, according to reporting from <a
                    href="https://www.klcc.org/breaking/2025-04-22/president-of-j-h-baxter-sentenced-to-90-days-in-jail">KLCC</a>.

            <p>Lisa's husband, Eric, is in treatment for diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor, a rare slow growing brain tumor
                that mostly affects children for the last three years.</p>
            <p>The couple are convinced living next to the facility led to Eric's cancer. Eric, who grew up right across the
                facility,
                still remembers the pungent odor stinging from JH Baxter in the 1980s.</p>
            <p>“I paid no attention to it,” Eric said about the smell.</p>
            <p>JH Baxter violated environmental regulations for decades but was only charged based on actions committed between Jan
                2,
                2019 and Oct 6, 2019. There are over 20 instances where three environmental agencies warned JH Baxter for going
                against
                air and water quality standards and hazardous waste regulations, according to a timeline from <a
                    ahref="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/61e11e3a99a54ff784a68ffacaccffcc">Oregon State University's</a>
                research team. Nearby residents filed over three thousand complaints between 2002 to 2022 about the pungent odor
                stinging from Baxter's facility.</p>

        <p>Two class action lawsuits were also filed in 2023, which includes “thousands of clients from the West Eugene area
            around
            JH Baxter, whose health or properties were allegedly affected by its operations,” according to reporting from

            <h2 class="subhead">The truth behind JH Baxter</h2>

        <p>JH Baxter is a 205 acre wood treatment site in West Eugene, Oregon that treated wood products like railroad ties,
        utility poles and crossarms for 79 years until 2022.</p>

            <p>Several schools are within three miles of the site. Students from Kalapuya High School have come to classes with
                hives,
                rashes and asthma, said Kelly Ferguson, a high school biology teacher.</p>
            <p>Ferguson uses self-reported data and research produced from state nonprofit Beyond Toxics Waste to teach her students
                on
                the impact the site has had on the surrounding area for decades. But with the Trump administration removing the
                environmental justice screening tool, Ferguson said it has been difficult to show how JH Baxter impacts the
                surrounding
                area.</p>
            <p>“We have a basic right to clean air, soil and water. That's our human right,” Ferguson said. She is finding
                alternative websites and spatial tools that replicate the EJ screening tool for her students.</p>
                <p>A 2023 <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/deq/Programs/Documents/JHBMeetingsummary071223.pdf">report from the Oregon
                        Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> found that
                    seven residential yards had soil “with dioxin concentrations over 40 parts per trillion (ppt).” This meant children
                    under six years old in contact with bare soil for a year or longer were at high risk. DEQ found an additional four
                    more yards with dangerous levels of dioxin concentration a year later.</p>
                <p>“DEQ has completed residential yard cleanup at seven of the 11 yards identified,” said Dylan Darlings, public affairs
                    specialist at the DEQ.</p>
                <p>The DEQ has spent about $2.6 million on cleaning up yards and all activities related to it, Darlings said. The agency
                    relied on the Orphan Fund, which is used to cover the clean up costs. But JH Baxter is the responsible party for the
                    cleanup and has been billed to pay, Darlings said. The site also owes over $350,000 in fines to the agency which it
                    is
                    accumulating with interest.</p>
                <p>JH Baxter's recent case focused on none of this. The court found that JH Baxter transferred wastewater to a wood
                    treatment retort to "boil it off” between January 2, 2019, to October 6, 2019 and would send the remaining waste to
                    an
                    offsite for disposal. The site did not have the permit to remove the waste which violated the Resource Conservation
                    and
                    Recovery Act.</p>
                <p><a
                        href="https://www.klcc.org/environment/2025-01-23/j-h-baxter-and-its-president-plead-guilty-to-environmental-violations-lying-to-federal-regulators?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Retorts</a>
                    are cylindrical vessels where chemicals are forced into the wood to preserve the material and make it resistant
                    to insects.The wastewater would discharge into the air which meant the facility dismissed the Clean Air Act
                    emissions
                    standards for hazardous air pollutants, according to court records.</p>
                <p>When the DEQ asked how many times JH Baxter used the retorts and requested for a documented record of the process,
                    Baxter-Krause falsely wrote back that "[J.H.] Baxter does not have specific dates when this practice occurred.”</p>
                <p>The court found employees actually “maintained detailed daily production logs for each retort,” and the facility
                    boiled off hazardous waste for 136 known days using multiple retorts.Baxter-Krause previously emailed only one
                    retort
                    was used.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/or/jh-baxter-wood-treating-facility-cleanup-investigation">EPA proposed</a> JH
                    Baxter to be on EPA's Superfund's National Priority List last September, a list of hazardous waste
                    sites that are considered to be the nation's most serious uncontrolled or abandoned releases of contamination.</p>
                <p>The agency can use federal funding called superfund for cleanup and enforcement on hazardous sites. The boundary of
                    the
                    superfund site can extend beyond JH Baxter but it is too early to say whether homes will be in the site boundary
                    right
                    now, said Alice Corcoran, a public affairs specialist with the EPA.</p>

Hi Becky,_x000D_
I have been really bad about reporting to LRAPA; mea culpa!  Decided I would send this to you and also to them at same time.  I don't see much difference in odor problems, despite the vaunted ""fixes"" supposedly made?  I think people are giving up, worn down, discouraged, etc. Not to mention summer means people are away a lot!  Okay, here goes (not sure when I last emailed LRAPA, so will go back to May)._x000D_

There were definitely about 6-8 other times when I notice odors just as I was leaving the house and later forgot to write them down.  I find it interesting how these times are all outside the scope of day time testing, or when anyone from LRAPA would be around to enjoy the odors for themselves._x000D_
Would just love the prez of Baxter to come live at my home some evening when it is 90 degrees out and the odor level is an 8 or above.  Talk about intruding on one's ability to enjoy their home!!  Thanks for jogging my memory about reporting these things.  I have been swamped all summer!_x000D_

Hello,_x000D_

I could smell that stinky sweet smell I've been telling you about as I_x000D_
passed by J H Baxter last night and this morning.  The smell was also_x000D_
lingering outside my house last night.  It's funny that if one of my_x000D_
neighbors creates a stinky nuisance next door I can make a complaint to_x000D_
city, but if it's some big company they can just continue to make even_x000D_
more horribly stenches that envelope entire neighborhoods and everyone_x000D_
just lays down and takes it. I am not sure whether it's J H Baxter or_x000D_
Weyerhaeuser, but I'm fairly sure it's J H Baxter.  I'm not sure if_x000D_
anybody is even reading these emails because I haven't received any_x000D_
responses to any of them.  Maybe it's just lack of funds keeping you_x000D_
overwhelmed with other work.  I just don't know what else to do than to_x000D_
tell you about every time I am annoyed by these people.  Something must be_x000D_

_x000D_
Greetings,_x000D_
I am writing to inquire as to whether there is a group or organization for_x000D_
the purpose of shutting down the Baxter Creosote plant.  I smell the odor_x000D_
every single day as I pass it on my way to work.  I smell it at my house_x000D_
approximately 3-5 days of the week.  It's a putrid petroleum chemical_x000D_
smell that prevents me from spending time outside my house.  I live on_x000D_
Wood ave near the intersection of Bertelsen and Roosevelt.  I can only_x000D_
imagine how much worse the smell must be for residents living even closer_x000D_
to the plant, as I live about a mile away.  With schools and homes so_x000D_
close, shouldn't the community consider decisive action?  Please let me_x000D_
know if there are any resources available on this topic._x000D_
Thank you for your time,_x000D_

Yesterday the air outside my home smelled very bad- a dense chemical odor that I have smelled on numerous previous ocassions. I noticed this in the early AM, around 6:30 or so._x000D_
_x000D_
I am disappointed that JH Baxter is still polluting the air in my neighborhood, despite all of our efforts and the expensive 'fixes'. There seem to be particular times when the smell is bad- cooler, early AM or later evening. _x000D_

I have not kept abreast of the Baxter permit application process, but I am opposed to any expansion of activity at this facility until this problem is COMPLETELY solved and we no longer must breathe contaminated air._x000D_

Detailed Description: This is probably the wrong place to register my complaint, but I couldn't find another place on your website. This is a complaint against giving the Baxter Plant permission to increase their emissions by 2000 %. This is ludicrous to allow any unnecessary harmful substances into the air in this valley, as you already know. I am so puzzled by LRAPA even considering this, since your mission statement is to preserve good air quality. By allowing pollution, you are essentially saying that one business is more important than the health of all the people living in this city and valley. Yes, all those sick people do add to the economy in the form of hospital visits, prescription drugs. This year was really hard for me, all summer I had asthma because of the poor air quality. This reduces my ability to teach singing and choir. When you multiply that reduced health and productivity by all the people living here, how can you justify it? How can you sleep at night, knowing people will get sicker here? I had a friend who lived near the Baxter Plant 10 years ago, but couldn't stand the fumes then. she called it Chernobyl, and eventually moved to Hawaii for clean air. She also had asthma, and value d her health more than her teaching job here. So we lost a productive tax paying citizen. She lost a good job, and her friends here. Many people who live near the plant cannot afford the luxury to move anywhere.... This is probably a waste of time to tell you the human side of the effects of air pollution, you've heard this before. You've probably received letters from doctors who specialize in pulmonary diseases, cancer specialists, etc.You've probably heard testimony from experts in pollution,  about the effects of carcinogenic chemicals in the air .  But for what it's worth,  consider this one vote against allowing Baxter more toxic disposal rights. If they want to expand their operations, they should build a bigger plant somewhere else, where toxic air isn't trapped in a valley. Maybe they could move to the coast, or east of the cascades. Really, if you vote to approve this, you might consider changing your mission statement to more accurately reflect your function in this community... I also request that you do not publish my name or contact information on the web. This input is for LRAPA only.  thank you for considering the health of our citizens._x000D_

The smell is so bad it made me throw up and have a migraine. Most Thursday nights are the worst. It is from the Baxter's place. It is a chemical smell, kind of like oil too. It hits you hard just out the front door and have to close all windows. This happens all of the time_x000D_

I pulled into the driveway after a long, difficult day at work, sat and pondered for a moment ""At least I have some work,right now''.Feeling joyful once again at the end of  this crisp, clear and dry day.I reflected on  a few of things I love about the Northwest and Eugene. I remembered how excited my wife and I were back in August of 2000 when we bought this home, our first, a real fixer.She saw the potential in it, just like she saw in me. After many remodels, additions, quarrels, make-ups, and more importantly raising our four beautiful children in it, it was definitely home for all of us.Memory lane just ran into a detour I'm hungry for dinner I said to myself. I got out of the truck, took a deep breath and ... choked, literally, nearly vomited but held back. I knew instantly what this foul odor of toxic vapors was and where it was coming from... Baxter, Aargh ! why on earth is this industry still allowed to spew this stench, airborne carcinogen ? _x000D_
 I read at the top of page right now ''Protecting public health, community well being and the environment as a leader and advocate for the improvement and maintenance of air quality in Lane County, Oregon.'' _x000D_
 My neighbors, my family, and I beg you, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do something today to stop this industry from destroying our quality of life._x000D_
Do something today with our hard earned tax dollars that will make a difference for the hundreds of us, who can only dream about living where you do, in a better neighborhood, like southeast Eugene or North or College Hill, or any where, miles away from Baxter, but may never live anywhere else but here, home._x000D_

The smell is horrible again. My husband said it was terrible this morning and now as usual on Thursday, it is terrible again. Again I have had to stay inside as I begin dry heaving and sometimes vomiting. It causes all of us to have headaches. Please please cant someone do something about this? Could someone come monitor my neighborhood on various days and times?

	Detailed Description: Hello,_x000D_
I would like to comment on a regular occurrence that your organization may already be aware of.  I live in the River Road area and am regularly confronted by a strong toxic odor of industry emissions from the Baxter Plant located in West Eugene.  I experience this odor 4 out of 7 days of the week in my location.  The odor is a toxin I cannot see, it occurs almost every evening around 7 or 8pm, is colorless and has no cloud or identifiable plume of smoke, etc. It ranges in strength from mildly noticeable (1-2 nights) to highly pungent and headache/loss of sleep educing (3-4 nights).   The toxic odor often lasts until about 8am the following morning and smells of mixed chemicals such as ammonia.   I have been surprised by so few complaints in your meeting minutes, the Register Guard and other publications and wonder if perhaps Crocker lane is in a more direct route of air movement from the plant.  I do think the River Road and overall Eugene Community is ignoring a severe hazar_x000D_
 d and I would be curious to meet with your staff and work with them however necessary to help monitor the air in our River Road neighborhoods.  I would also like to learn more about the toxins being emitted, the levels, the lack of reduction and reporting by this local business.  While I want to support a strong economy, business and employment, I want to do my due diligence in being educated, educating others and moving forward with healthy community action.  I would like to speak with any staff looking for community support in gathering data, sharing educational materials or doing outreach to community members.  I recently went to the bank to evaluate my total capacity for a new home loan so I could move--because of this toxic saturation--but I realize I need to do something other than just ignore the problem.  Moving is a real consideration because this occurrence is ruining my life--I absolutely cannot live in a home where I am exposed to toxins every night as I garden a  nd as I sleep.  Feel free to contact me and thank you for acting as a resource to our community.  -Jeremy Olsen 541-510-1929_x000D_

The smell is not a typical household smell such as paint, paint thinner, wood burning or smoke but rather unique to industrial pollution and particulates moving in the wind.

Subject: [www.lrapa.org Contact Form] Chemical Smell in the Air in South Eugene on Many occasions_x000D_
_x000D_
Hello._x000D_
I've noticed more and more the bad chemical smell, similar to the smell off Rt. 99 near the Baxter plant, that pervades South Eugene and of course, in the surrounding areas when I'm in N.W. Eugene. I notice it on many Sundays and today, for example, also when my daughter plays sports on the fields in N.W. Eugene schools._x000D_
_x000D_
Isn't there something LRAPA can do to require emission reductions at the plants that are creating this toxic smell? I worry about not only my children  but those families that live very near by the offending plants._x000D_
Certainly if I smell it at 44th Ave. and Amazon Parkway, they have it 10 times as bad._x000D_
_x000D_
Please advise of any plans you may have to remedy this issue._x000D_

Thanks,_x000D_

I hold my breath as I move from my car to the house, scurrying inside as quickly as possible. However, it is not as strong as the acrid smells that sometimes permeate the air when I literally feel my eyes, nose, and throat burning. _x000D_
My son and I have lived in this home at 310 Archie Street for less than a year. Since then, my son has developed a ""catch"" in his throat where he cannot clear it. I have frequent, new, heart palpitations and shortness of breath. _x000D_
Moving here ten months ago is my first experience spending any time on the west side of Eugene. The air here is routinely horrible. Even if there is no immediately noxious and identifiable smell as there is at this moment, the air feels bad, triggering an involuntary response to get indoors so as not to breathe deeply. There is no desire to walk (although we are near the walking trail flanking Roosevelt Avenue) or spend time outside. The worst of it hits me when I am driving from Elimira and I turn on Archie Street, toward home, when the fumes literally take all my attention away and force me to hold my breath insofar as possible until I get home. _x000D_

Baxter & Company located at: 3494 Roosevelt Blvd, Eugene, OR 97402, however the DEQ form won't download. Please accept this email as my formal complaint. _x000D_
I have lived in my present home now for almost 5 years and the chemical smells coming from Baxter have only gotten worse, as is my health. I now have unusual and unexplained health issues. _x000D_
Several times a year the smell is so bad that I have to stay inside my home because going outside my eyes burn and it's hard to breathe. I stopped calling the fire department when I couldn't breathe outside because they simply report, that's just J.H. Baxter. I have even contacted J.H. Baxter directly on more than one occasion to request copies of their MSDS sheets so that I can be informed about what it is that I'm inhaling, each request has gone ignored. _x000D_
Can you please let me know what I myself or DEQ can do about this? _x000D_
I understand that J.H. Baxter has never met any of their penalty requirements regarding any one of their past environmental contaminations, so it is unclear to me how they are continuing to be allowed to operate as they are._x000D_

Baxter and review their activities on 10/13/2021 to assess if any upset (aka non-permitted) emissions were released. He'll also assess yesterday's weather conditions, such as examining wind direction, to confirm/suspect/unconfirm/other the odor to Baxter. Because you live so near to Baxter, weather and wind play less of a role in this determination as others who live farther away._x000D_
_x000D_
I also want to provide an update to you on J.H. Baxter's progress through Cleaner Air Oregon. Baxter has made progress finalizing liquid sampling data taken in February and June 2021, as well as made headway on source-testing. (Source-testing, aka ""stack-testing"", is a process that directly measures air emissions from multiple points throughout the facility. This testing is useful to estimate the type and quantity of emissions more accurately.) These efforts help establish an accurate Emissions Inventory. An Emissions Inventory is a list of which 600 pollutants regulated by Cleaner Air Oregon are emitted by Baxter and in what quantity. This information is essentially to make a health risk assessment of Baxter's emissions and allow LRAPA to regulate Baxter further depending on the result of that risk assessment._x000D_
_x000D_
On August 5, 2021, the facility submitted a letter to LRAPA explaining the delays in the liquid sample results which were taken earlier this year. (Liquid sampling is a method of measuring the type and quantity of chemicals in the liquids of a facility's process. This sampling is useful to estimate the type and quantity of chemicals in air emissions more accurately.) The letter and all other documents referenced in this email are posted to LRAPA's facility specific webpage on Baxter which you can view by clicking here. The letter can be read by clicking here. The letter explains in full, but to state it simply: liquid sampling is a delicate sampling method and extra steps have been taken for Baxter's samples to assure the data acquired from them is accurate and representative of Baxter's processes. Completing these extra steps has extended the time needed for independent third-party laboratories to finish analyzing due to a large demand and heavy workloads across the lab analysis industry._x000D_
_x000D_
On August 6, 2021, the facility submitted their source-testing protocol for the carbon adsorption unit, penta stack, and ammonia scrubber. This protocol is a plan detailing how an independent third-party company will conduct source-testing at Baxter. LRAPA reviewed this plan, requested clarification, and added requirements or changes to it. Baxter incorporated LRAPA's feedback and submitted a revised source-testing protocol for the ammonia scrubber on September 8, 2021. This plan was approved by LRAPA on September 10, and source-testing of the ammonia scrubber occurred on September 22 and 23, 2021. If interested, that source-testing protocol can be viewed here._x000D_
_x000D_
On September 10, 2021, Baxter submitted a summary table of all validated liquid sample data. This is preliminary data but is useful to LRAPA and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to further agency work on Baxter ahead of receiving the full liquid sampling lab report from the independent third-party laboratories. View this table here._x000D_
_x000D_
Source-testing is planned for the carbon adsorption unit, penta stack, and additional permanent total enclosure (PTE) verification. PTE verification will demonstrate and confirm that assumptions made in certain emission inventory estimations are correct. Independent third-party companies that conduct source testing are busy with limited availability. The expectation is this testing will occur in late November or early December dependent on the source testing company's schedule and availability._x000D_
_x000D_
Again, thank you for informing me of the fumes and odor you experienced. LRAPA is interested to hear of these instances so they can be documented and overtime can become useful tools when working with Baxter to make changes and improvements at the facility._x000D_

Hi Kayla,_x000D_
_x000D_
I will log a complaint and forward it onward to a compliance officer._x000D_
_x000D_
A question for you: what's your approximate address? Our compliance officers asked for a better idea to where you're located. It would be helpful in evaluating the JHB process activity that may be the source of the odor that you report, if you're uncomfortable giving your exact address, would provide the block number of the street whereby you notice the odor. Can be, for example, the ""3100 blk Coraly"" or ""Coraly and Anton.""_x000D_
_x000D_
I recall you saying from an ABC community meeting in April that you lived in the cul-de-sac on Coraly ave. Homes 3380-3397. Is this correct?_x000D_

Hi Kayla,_x000D_
_x000D_
I have filed your complaint and assigned it to a compliance officer (#26390). They will review last night's wind direction and J.H. Baxter's activities to confirm them as a source of the odor. We've been onsite at Baxter twice in November in response to an increase in air quality complaints in your area. Baxter's carbon adsorption unit was tested using a Photoionization Detector (PID) in November as well, the results from that test indicated that the carbon adsorption unit was functioning above the minimum level required by their air permit._x000D_
_x000D_
J.H. Baxter also makes progress through Cleaner Air Oregon, with stack testing for their emission inventory schedule in early December. I will be publishing an update onto J.H.

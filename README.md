## What is this story about? 
#### A wood facility site named JH Baxter polluted the groundwater, air and released hazardous waste for decades. This is the story of how residents have been and continue to be impacted by it and the actions residents took to finally see JH Baxter plead guilty this year. 

## What did I have to do to make this story a reality 

#### 1. FOIA Requests 
####    a. I FOIA requested for all received by the  Lane Regional Air Protection Agency (LRAPA) regarding J.H. Baxter in Eugene, OR between 2002 to 2022. This helped with my reporting because it offers a glimpse of how residents were reacting to the strong odors and waste produced by JH Baxter. 

#### 2. Court records
####    a. I used Pacer to read and analyze UNITED STATES OF AMERICA vs. J.H. BAXTER & CO., A CALIFORNIA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, et al. These court records showed specifically what JH Baxter was guilty for. It revealed the corporation and the president pleaded guilty for actions between January 2019 to October 2019. In reality, there is evidence showing JH Baxter had over 20 violations with three different enviromental agencies spanning decades.
